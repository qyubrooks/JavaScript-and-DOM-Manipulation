## Insert Table and Date Search Button

* Use a basic HTML web page 

* Use the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in my HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
